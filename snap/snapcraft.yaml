name: dashboard-ui
base: core20
version: '0.1' 
summary: Dashboard UI
description: |
  This is a small demo put together by the Canonical team. It features a dashboard not unlike the one you would
  have in Auto. It is used to illustrate the power of snaps in Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core.

  The dashboard-ui is "powered" by the dashboard-controller snap. So you want BOTH installed.

  If you then go in dashboard-controller and edit the code for the color (device-controller/app/main.py), the dashboard will change colors. 
  Valid colors are blue, green and red. If you try to put another color, the ui will not accept it and request
  snapd to revert the controller to its previous version (because, yes, you can do that with snaps).
  
  Furthermore, you will need to ensure that the proper plugs are connected to the proper slots. This is what you should have:

  For dashboard-controller
  Interface     Plug                                      Slot          Notes
  network       dashboard-controller:network              :network       -
  network-bind  dashboard-controller:network-bind         :network-bind  -

  For dashboard-ui
  Interface      Plug                                      Slot          Notes
  network        dashboard-ui:network                     :network        -
  network-bind   dashboard-ui:network-bind                :network-bind   -
  snapd-control  dshboard-ui:snapd-control                :snapd-control  manual

  Note: both the network and network-bind will be connected automatically. But snapd-control WON'T BE
  VERY IMPORTANT: DO -> sudo snap connect dashboard-ui:snapd-control (which will connect to :snapd-control)
  OTHERWISE the rollback capability will NOT WORK
